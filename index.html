        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a full time DevOps Engineer with a rather unconventional path — from a career in television presenting to building scalable systems and automating complex infrastructures. My storytelling background helps me communicate technical concepts clearly, while my engineering experience ensures that every solution I design is grounded in efficiency, reliability, and impact.

Over the years, I have developed strong hands-on experience across modern DevOps stacks — working daily with Ansible AWX Tower, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, and Linux-based environments. I thrive on creating seamless automation workflows, optimizing pipelines, and implementing monitoring solutions with Zabbix, Grafana (Loki), and PostgreSQL to ensure continuous visibility into system performance.

I am deeply familiar with AWS DevOps frameworks, leveraging EC2, S3, CloudWatch, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to create resilient, scalable cloud systems. My work aligns with the CALMS model of DevOps — emphasizing collaboration, automation, lean principles, measurement, and continuous improvement.

What makes my journey unique is how I merge communication and engineering. Whether documenting architectures, collaborating with offshore teams, or breaking down complex technical ideas for an audience, I bring clarity and enthusiasm to everything I build.

Outside work, I enjoy creating educational content about AI, DevOps, and modern software engineering, helping others bridge the gap between curiosity and capability. I also moderate/host events varying from tech to lifestyle, yes, that diverse</p>
